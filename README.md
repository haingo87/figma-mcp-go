# figma-mcp-go

> A **zero-cost, unlimited** Figma MCP server — no API key, no rate limits, just a single Go binary.

Works with Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and any MCP-compatible AI tool.

## Why this exists

Most Figma MCP servers rely on the **Figma REST API**.

That sounds fine… until you hit this:

| Plan | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Starter / View / Collab | **6 tool calls/month** |
| Pro / Org (Dev seat) | 200 tool calls/day |
| Enterprise | 600 tool calls/day |

If you're experimenting with AI tools, you’ll burn through that in minutes.

I didn’t have enough money to pay for higher limits.
So I built something that **doesn’t use the API at all**.

## What’s different

**figma-mcp-go is just a binary.**

It works through a lightweight **Figma plugin** that connects directly to your open file via a local WebSocket.

No API.
No rate limits.
No API key.
No billing surprises.

Just your AI tool talking straight to Figma.

## How it works

```
AI tool -> figma-mcp-go -> Figma Plugin
```

Multiple AI tool instances are supported!

## Setup

### 1. Configure your AI tool

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-mcp-go": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Install the Figma plugin

1. In Figma Desktop: **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest**
2. Select `plugin/manifest.json` from this repo (or in the release download)
3. Run the plugin inside any Figma file — the status badge turns green when connected
